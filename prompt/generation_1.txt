[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine topics mentioned in the document. 
- The topic labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must have a level number, a short general label, and a topic description. 
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics. 
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations: 
1. If there are already duplicates or relevant topics in the hierarchy, output those topics and stop here. 
2. If the document contains no topic, return "None". 
3. Otherwise, add your topic as a top-level topic. Stop here and output the added topic(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.
